# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Detection (ML)

This repository contains a machine learning project to detect **Parkinson's disease** using biomedical voice measurement data. The project uses **XGBoost** for classification and includes **data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder affecting movement. By analyzing biomedical voice features, this project aims to predict whether an individual has Parkinson’s disease with high accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File**: `Parkinsson disease.csv`
- **Description**: Contains biomedical voice measurements of patients.
- **Target Column**: `status`
  - `1` → Parkinson's positive  
  - `0` → Healthy
